#Project 3 - Celeb Lookalike

##Description: 

Our application compares information inputted by the user to a large database of celebrity faces and attribute 
information to find celebrities that look similar. For storing and utilizing the data, we used two data structures,
a graph and a hashtable, and the GUI uses the pygame library. We chose to use a graph because it allows for weights
between nodes, which is useful for showing similarities between the user and other celebrities. The hashtable is useful 
for storing the celebrity data, as it allows for quick lookups.

##Use: 

After running main.py, a gui is opened where the user inputs data about their physical 
features. (finish this)
